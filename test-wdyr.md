# WDYR Test Guide

## ✅ Fixed Issues

1. **Import Path Issue**: Fixed the `../../wdyr` path to `../wdyr`
2. **Server-Side Import**: Moved WDYR to a client component (`WDYRProvider`)
3. **Environment Variables**: Added `cross-env` for proper environment variable handling
4. **Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks for robust error handling

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Regular Development Mode
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
- Should start without WDYR
- No performance dashboard
- Normal development experience

### 2. WDYR Development Mode
```bash
pnpm run dev:wdyr
```
- Should start with WDYR enabled
- Performance dashboard appears in top-right corner
- Console logs show WDYR initialization

### 3. Check Browser Console
Open browser console and look for:
```
🔍 WDYR initialized successfully
```

### 4. Performance Dashboard
- Should appear in top-right corner
- Shows real-time metrics
- Displays WDYR logs
- Collapsible interface

### 5. Component Optimization
- Hero component should be memoized
- Services component should be optimized
- Performance tracking should be active

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Console Output
```
🔍 WDYR initialized successfully
🔍 [WDYR] Hero mounted
🔍 [WDYR] Services mounted
🔍 [WDYR] ServiceCard rendered in Xms
```

### Performance Dashboard
- Render count increasing
- Average render time displayed
- Memory and CPU usage
- Recent re-render logs

### Visual Indicators
- Smooth animations
- Responsive design
- SKYBER branding (#17D492)
- Modern glassmorphism effects

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If WDYR doesn't initialize:
1. Check console for errors
2. Verify `cross-env` is installed
3. Ensure environment variables are set correctly

### If Performance Dashboard doesn't appear:
1. Check if WDYR environment variable is set
2. Verify the component is imported in layout
3. Check browser console for errors

### If components aren't optimized:
1. Verify React.memo is applied
2. Check WDYR tracking is enabled
3. Monitor console for render logs

## ✅ Success Criteria

- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] WDYR initializes successfully
- [ ] Performance dashboard appears
- [ ] Console shows component tracking
- [ ] Animations are smooth
- [ ] No build errors
- [ ] Production build works (WDYR disabled)

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

Your SKYBER project is now fully optimized with WDYR performance monitoring!
